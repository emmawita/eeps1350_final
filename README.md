## **Mapping Heat Vulnerability and Temperature Monitoring Sensor Suitability in Rhode Island**

### Abstract: 

Heat vulnerability across Rhode Island was evaluated at the block group level, integrating socio-demographic, housing, health, temperature, and landcover data to construct a heat vulnerability index (HVI), utilizing a principal component analysis. Results revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity, with higher vulnerability concentrated in urban centers, while rural areas generally showed lower risk. Suitability analysis for temperature sensors placement highlighted gaps in current monitoring infrastructure and identified optimal locations to enhance coverage, equity, and future adaptation.
